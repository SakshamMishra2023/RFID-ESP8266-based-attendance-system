# RFID-based-attendance-system

Developed a smart attendance system leveraging RFID technology and the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller. This innovative project streamlines the process of attendance tracking and enhances accuracy and efficiency. Key features and details include:

- Components Used:
 - RFID Reader and Tags: Utilized RFID technology to uniquely identify users.
 - NodeMCU ESP8266: Served as the core microcontroller for handling data processing and Wi-Fi connectivity.

- Functionalities:
 - Real-Time Attendance Tracking: Users swipe their RFID cards to log attendance, which is immediately recorded and reflected on the webpage.
 - Wi-Fi Connectivity: The NodeMCU ESP8266 communicates with the cloud to update attendance records in real-time.
 - User Management: Admin can add or remove users and their corresponding RFID tags from the system
